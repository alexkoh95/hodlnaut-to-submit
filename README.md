## Questions

### 1. (Optional) If you didnâ€™t have time to complete your intended design, what else would you have done?

ANSWER:
Ideally I would have liked more time to learn what is expected professionally when writing tests. I have written 4 basic tests as mentioned in the comments to describe the test in test.js

### 2. Which took the most time? What did you find most difficult?

ANSWER:
There were two parts to the test which I spent the most time on: (1) Making my codes as modular as possible and (2) Learning Mocha and Chai to write tests.

(1) From articles I have read, it seems the best practice is to make code as modular as possible. This improves productivity as apps are not only able to scale but also able to be quickly restructured to adapt to business needs.

(2) I have not written tests before, thus I had to read the documentation for Mocha and Chai.

### 3. If we wanted the balance to update on the frontend more often (10 times per second), how would you improve the current system to handle this?

ANSWER:
I have not encountered a requirement where the frontend has needed to update more than 10x a second. However, based on the documentation in Express I have done the following to maximise the speed of the application:

a) Avoid synchronous functions
b) Remove console.logs where relevant to improve speed
c) Handle exceptions with try-catch

### 4. How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them!

ANSWER:
I found this test enjoyable as I have learnt a lot in two areas.

First, pushing myself to make my code as modular as possible. For example, removing the business logic of calculating account value and placing it in the services folder as "currency-service.js".

Second, learning how to write tests. Tests were briefly covered in the curriculum in General Assembly but I have not practiced it before. I am glad that I had a chance to learn and implement it!
